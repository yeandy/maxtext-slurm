# MaxText on Slurm

Toolkit for launching and observing [MaxText](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext) — a [JAX](https://jax.dev/)-based LLM training framework — on [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/)-managed AMD GPU clusters. One command runs distributed training with model selection, container setup, and multi-node coordination handled automatically. A carefully designed [observability](docs/observability.md) stack (via `RAY=1`) records GPU state, host health, network diagnostics, and training metrics into a single [time-series database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series_database) (TSDB) — essential for monitoring long-running production training, diagnosing incidents, and day-to-day tuning and validation.

An extensible [AI skill framework](skills/) equips AI assistants with out-of-the-box domain expertise across the full training lifecycle — from profiling and performance analysis to production incident diagnosis — with more skills added over time.

This is a **reference implementation** of a [layered](docs/architecture.md) launch architecture where each tier — orchestration, container, training, and even GPU vendor — can be [adapted independently](docs/extensibility.md) without cascading changes. See [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) for the full training flow and [Extensibility](docs/extensibility.md) for what each swap involves.

## Quickstart

Clone the repo onto a Slurm-managed GPU cluster and run:

```bash
submit.sh 70b -N 1              # Train llama2-70b on 1 node
run_local.sh 70b -- steps=10    # Run locally (no Slurm)
RAY=1 submit.sh 70b -N 1        # With full-stack observability
```

`70b`, `mixtral`, `grok`, etc. are short names that resolve to config files in [`configs/`](configs). To train a model not already listed, [add a config](docs/model-configs.md#adding-a-new-config).

**Shared filesystem.** Multi-node jobs need all nodes to reach the output directory. Either clone this repo onto a shared filesystem (the default `outputs/` dir works as-is), or set `JOB_WORKSPACE` to a shared path.

```bash
# Common options
JOB_WORKSPACE=/shared/maxtext_jobs submit.sh 70b -N 1            # Shared FS for outputs
submit.sh 70b -N 1 -- remat_policy=full per_device_batch_size=2  # MaxText args after --
submit.sh 70b -N 1 -- _env_NCCL_DEBUG=INFO                       # Env var overrides
STAGE_TIMEOUTS="preflight:600,train:86400" submit.sh 70b -N 24   # Per-stage timeouts
```

## Observe

`RAY=1` adds full-stack observability with no measurable steady-state throughput impact. Fully self-contained in the [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)-based stack — all necessary components are installed automatically at container startup, no cluster-wide setup required. Powered by [Ray](https://www.ray.io/) and [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) with an [extensible plugin system](docs/observability.md#customizing-metrics), the pipeline collects GPU, host, network, and [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard) training metrics into a single Prometheus TSDB — persisted to the shared filesystem, queryable live and after the job ends, making the TSDB the **ground truth data layer** for automated reasoning and diagnosis.

```bash
RAY=1 submit.sh 70b -N 8
```

### Live dashboards

| Dashboard | What it shows | Port |
|-----------|--------------|------|
| TensorBoard | Training loss curves, learning rate schedules | 6006 |
| Ray Dashboard | Actor status, live stack traces, flame graphs | 8265 |
| Prometheus | GPU, host, network, and training metrics — unified TSDB | 9190 (auto-increments if occupied) |

### Post-run browsing

```bash
utils/prometheus.sh list                                          # List jobs with saved metrics
utils/prometheus.sh view outputs/12345-JAX-llama2-70b/prometheus  # Browse metrics after the job ends
```

### Telegram notifications

Push notifications for job state changes and hang detection — works with any Slurm job, no `RAY=1` required. See [Notifications](docs/notifications.md) for setup.

```bash
utils/slurm_job_monitor.sh -j <slurm_job_id>
```

See [Observability](docs/observability.md) for the full story.
